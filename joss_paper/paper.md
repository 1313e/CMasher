# Introduction

The use of colorizations in the visualization of scientific results is a common sight nowadays.
It allows for more (complex) data to be plotted in the same figure without having to resort to difficult-to-read 3D plots or subplots; online material; or interactive applications.
However, an often underappreciated aspect of the choice of colormap, is how colorization affects the way the visualized data is interpreted.


# Background summary

A good scientific colormap is often described/characterized as _perceptually uniform sequential_ [@Rogowitz96; @Sharpe99], which means that it is perceived as uniformly changing in lightness and saturation, mostly at the same hue.
This allows for the data values of a plot to be interpreted correctly by the viewer without giving false information.
It also often allows for a plot to be converted properly to grey-scale without losing information.
Basically, it should be possible to infer how every color relates in terms of value to every other color, by simply looking at it (so, a legend or colorbar should NOT be necessary for this task).

Although there are many works out there that describe the optimal way to do this [@Kindlmann02; @Birch12; @Brychtova16; @Szafir18] and there are tools readily available to test the performance of a colormap [@cmaputil; @colorspacious; @viscm], bad/misleading colormaps are still very commonly used.
The main problem usually is that humans do not perceive every color equally (e.g., small variations in the color green are not perceived as it is such a natural color, while small variations in the colors red and blue are perceived).
A good example of a colormap that illustrates this, is the commonly used *jet* colormap:

![Output of the ``viscm`` package showing the statistics and performance of the *jet* colormap. The various different plots show how the colormap changes in perceived color and lightness, as well as how well the colormap converts to different types of color-vision deficiency (CVD; color blindness) and grey-scale. In case of a perceptually uniform sequential colormap, the two derivative plots should show a straight horizontal line; the colorspace diagram should be smooth; and the lines in the right-bottom corner plots should be visible up to the same depth across the entire colormap.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1313e/CMasher/master/docs/source/user/images/jet_viscm.png)

In Fig. 1, you can view the statistics output of the *jet* colormap, made with the ``viscm`` package [@viscm].
This colormap shows the spectrum of visible light, which trivially increases linearly in wavelength.
However, we can clearly see that this introduces multiple problems, as the color green is perceived as the brightest of the visible colors due to its very natural occurance, and the colormap is absolutely not CVD-friendly.
This is an example of a colormap where it would be necessary to have a colorbar/legend, and it is overall a bad colormap to use.

Despite all of these problems, the *jet* colormap is still a very commonly used colormap.
An often cited reason for this (besides the general _"Everyone else uses it."_), is that *jet* has a high perceptual range, making it easier to distinguish adjacent values (it has a higher perceptual range than any colormap in *CMasher*, including the diverging colormaps).
Although this can be useful in many different cases, it certainly is not useful in all of them and there are ways to achieve this without giving false information.
In order to solve the problem of not knowing when to use what colormap, I introduce the *CMasher* package.


# CMasher

The *CMasher* package provides a collection of scientific colormaps to be used by different Python packages and projects, mainly in combination with ``matplotlib`` [@MPL].
The colormaps in *CMasher* are all designed to be perceptually uniform sequential using the ``viscm`` package [@viscm], most of them are CVD-friendly and they cover a wide range of different color combinations to accommodate for most applications.
It offers several alternatives to commonly used colormaps, like *chroma* and *rainforest* for *jet*; *sunburst* for *hot*; *neutral* for *binary*; and *fusion* and *redshift* for *coolwarm*.
Users are encouraged to request for specific colormaps to be designed if they cannot find the perfect one.
An overview of all current colormaps in *CMasher* is shown in Fig. 2.

*CMasher* has already been used in several scientific studies, including model emulations [@PRISM_JOSS; @PRISM_ApJS]; galaxy kinematics (D탑ud탑ar et al., in prep); and redshift estimations for fast radio bursts [@Fruitbat].
Due to the number of different color sequences and the perceptual uniform sequential nature of most colormaps, *CMasher* is also great for representing discrete data.
The source code for *CMasher* (including the ``viscm`` source files) can be found at https://github.com/1313e/CMasher, whereas the descriptions of all available colormaps can be found at https://cmasher.readthedocs.io with their recommended use-cases.
