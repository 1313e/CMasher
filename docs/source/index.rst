*CMasher*; scientific colormaps for making stunning and smashing plots
======================================================================

This is the documentation for the *CMasher* package, a collection of scientific colormaps for making stunning and smashing plots.
It is written in pure `Python 2/3`_ and `publicly available on GitHub`_.

The colormaps in *CMasher* are all designed to be perceptually uniform sequential, most of them are color vision deficiency (CVD; colorblind) friendly and they cover a wide range of different color combinations to accommodate for most applications.
If you cannot find your ideal colormap here, then please open an `issue`_, provide the colors and/or style you want, and I will try to create one to your liking!
Let's get rid of all bad colormaps in the world together!
