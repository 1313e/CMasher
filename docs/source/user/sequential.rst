Sequential colormaps
====================
Sequential colormaps (that are perceptually uniform of course) are basic colormaps that start at a reasonably low lightness value and uniformly increase to a higher value.
They are commonly used to represent information that is ordered.
The *matplotlib* package already has a few great sequential colormaps readily available for the user, mainly the colormaps named *viridis*; *plasma*; *inferno*; *magma*; and *cividis*.
However, three of these colormaps use the color red as their main color and none of them uses the full lightness range.
As it might sometimes be desirable to use a different main color or maximize the lightness range of the colormap, *CMasher* provides a few sequential colormaps that do exactly that.
These colormaps are shown in an overview and described individually below.
