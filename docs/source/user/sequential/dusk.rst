The *dusk* colormap is a visual representation of what the sky looks like during dusk (with the black/blue representing the dark sky and the orange/red the last few sunrays above the horizon).
It covers the :math:`[0, 85]` lightness range and has the colors blue and orange as its main colors.
It features a greyish area in the middle, making it great for representing ordered information where the extremes should be the main focus of the image.
