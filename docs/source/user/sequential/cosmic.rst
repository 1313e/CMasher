The *cosmic* colormap is a visual representation of the cosmos, with the black/purple representing the vast emptiness of space and the purple/blue the bright stars and galaxies. 
It covers almost the full lightness range (:math:`[0, 90]`) and uses several shades of blue.
As with other colormaps that only use a single color, this colormap is great for representing smooth information.
