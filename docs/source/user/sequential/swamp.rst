The *swamp* colormap is a visual representation of the wet swamp ecosystems.
It covers the full lightness range and uses the colors blue and green.
Its smoothly varying colors makes it great for intensity maps.
As the *swamp* colormap uses softer colors, it can be used as an alternative to the :ref:`toxic` colormap.
