Sequential colormaps
====================
This colormap overview shows all sequential colormaps in *matplotlib* and *CMasher*.
The colormaps are sorted on their name (note that colormap types are not used).
The overview has its title set to :pycode:`"Sequential MPL Colormaps"` instead of the default.
