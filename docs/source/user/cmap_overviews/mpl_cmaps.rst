Full overview
=============
This colormap overview shows all colormaps in *matplotlib* and *CMasher*.
The colormaps are sorted on their type and lightness profile.
The individual lightness profiles are shown as well.
Note that perceptually uniform sequential colormaps should show no curves or changes in their lightness profile (except for diverging/cyclic colormaps, which have a single sharp transition in the center).
