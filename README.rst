Description
===========
This package contains a collection of scientific colormaps for making stunning and smashing plots.
The colormaps in CMasher are all designed to be perceptually uniform sequential, most of them are color vision deficiency (CVD; colorblind) friendly and they cover a wide range of different color combinations to accommodate for most applications.
If you cannot find your ideal colormap here, then please open an `issue`_, provide the colors and/or style you want, and I will try to create one to your liking!
Let's get rid of all bad colormaps in the world together!
