*CMasher*: Scientific colormaps for making accessible, informative and *cmashing* plots
=======================================================================================
The *CMasher* package provides a collection of scientific colormaps and utility functions to be used by different *Python* packages and projects, mainly in combination with `matplotlib`_, showcased in the `online documentation`_.
The colormaps in *CMasher* are all designed to be perceptually uniform sequential using the `viscm`_ package; most of them are color-vision deficiency friendly; and they cover a wide range of different color combinations to accommodate for most applications.
It offers several alternatives to commonly used colormaps, like *chroma* and *rainforest* for *jet*; *sunburst* for *hot*; *neutral* for *binary*; and *fusion* and *redshift* for *coolwarm*.
If you cannot find your ideal colormap, then please open an `issue`_, provide the colors and/or style you want, and I will try to create one to your liking!
Let's get rid of all bad colormaps in the world together!

*If you use CMasher for your work, then please star the repo, such that I can keep track of how many users it has and more easily raise awareness of bad colormaps.*
*Additionally, if you use CMasher as part of your workflow in a scientific publication, please consider citing the CMasher paper* (*BibTeX:* ``cmr.get_bibtex``).

Colormap overview
-----------------
Below is an overview of all the colormaps that are currently in *CMasher* (made with the ``cmr.create_cmap_overview()`` function).
For more information, see the `online documentation`_.

Installation & Use
==================
How to install
--------------
*CMasher* can be easily installed directly from `PyPI`_ with::

    $ pip install cmasher

or from `conda-forge`_ with::

    $ conda install -c conda-forge cmasher  # If conda-forge is not set up as a channel
    $ conda install cmasher                 # If conda-forge is set up as a channel

If required, one can also clone the `repository`_ and install *CMasher* manually::

    $ git clone https://github.com/1313e/CMasher
    $ cd CMasher
    $ pip install .

*CMasher* can now be imported as a package with ``import cmasher as cmr``.

.. _PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/CMasher
.. _conda-forge: https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/CMasher

Example use
-----------
The colormaps shown above can be accessed by simply importing *CMasher*.
This makes them available in the ``cmasher`` module, in addition to registering them in *matplotlib*'s ``cm`` module (with added ``'cmr.'`` prefix to avoid name clashes).
So, for example, if one were to use the *rainforest* colormap, this could be done with:

.. code:: python

    # Import CMasher to register colormaps
    import cmasher as cmr

    # Import packages for plotting
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np

    # Access rainforest colormap through CMasher or MPL
    cmap = cmr.rainforest                   # CMasher
    cmap = plt.get_cmap('cmr.rainforest')   # MPL

    # Generate some data to plot
    x = np.random.rand(100)
    y = np.random.rand(100)
    z = x**2+y**2

    # Make scatter plot of data with colormap
    plt.scatter(x, y, c=z, cmap=cmap, s=300)
    plt.show()

For other use-cases, including an overview of *CMasher*'s utility functions, see the `online documentation`_.
